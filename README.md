# BigNaturals

This project is a naive implementation of a BigNatural class. It allows you to du calculs on arbitrary big naturals numbers. 

The solution choosen to store digits isn't efficient at all, and logic used for multiplication/division/modulo is a naive approach. Moreover +=, -=, *= and /= should be redone, large optimisation on allocations could be done in my opinion.
